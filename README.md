EECS 504 Fall 2020 at University of Michigan Final Project Assignment regarding paper flattening.

[Paper]() | [Presentation]() | [Demo]()

## Dependencies

* Python3
* Windows or Linux
* CUDA and CuDNN

## Demo
To run the demo on your location machine, please run the following code in the main directory:

`python app.py`

## Generate Your Own Dataset
Generating your own dataset is a great way to train an existing model. However, the format of the dataset must match what the model expects.

To generate your own dataset, run and edit accordingly the following code:

`python generate_perturbations.py`

Our sample dataset is located [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CA6YbR_N1gXBOYSqL5V9Zih7dudRGMLk/view?usp=sharing).

To see the math worksheet solved, please run the following code:

`python generate_answer_key.py -mathWorksheet pathToWorksheet.png`

where the path to the worksheet is a full path.
